OatMeal Recipe:
Simply boil water and add your oatmeal. The quantity you add is dependent on the consistency you want. Stir and allow to stand for a few minutes.
Add milk and sugar as per choice. You can also use the oat meal in place of garri for the Nigerian cuisine Eba and soup also commonly refered to 
as "swallow". In that case the consistency is made to be as thick as you have for garri. Also no sugar or milk is added.
